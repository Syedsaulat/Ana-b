# Business AI Agent: Architecture Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the Business AI Agent, designed based on the requirements specified in `agent_requirements.md`. The architecture aims to be modular, scalable, and adaptable to support market analysis, lead generation, and other business intelligence tasks.

## 2. Architectural Style

A modular, agent-based architecture is proposed. This involves breaking down the agent's functionalities into distinct, specialized modules (or sub-agents) coordinated by a central control unit. This approach promotes:

*   **Modularity:** Easier development, testing, and maintenance of individual components.
*   **Scalability:** Components can be scaled independently based on load.
*   **Flexibility:** New functionalities can be added by developing new modules.

## 3. Core Components

The agent will consist of the following core components:

1.  **Control Unit / Orchestrator:** The central brain of the agent. It receives user requests, breaks them down into tasks, assigns tasks to appropriate modules, manages workflow, and synthesizes results.
2.  **User Interface (UI) / Interaction Module:** Handles communication with the user (input commands, display results). This could be a command-line interface (CLI), a web interface, or an API.
3.  **Data Collection Module:** Responsible for gathering raw data from diverse sources:
    *   **Web Scraper:** Extracts information from websites (competitor sites, news portals, social media, directories). Needs robust handling of anti-scraping measures and respect for `robots.txt`.
    *   **API Connectors:** Integrates with external APIs (e.g., financial data providers like Alpha Vantage, news APIs like NewsAPI, social media APIs, CRM APIs).
    *   **Database Connectors:** Accesses public or potentially private databases.
4.  **Data Processing Module:** Cleans, validates, transforms, and structures the raw data collected. This includes:
    *   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats.
    *   **Data Transformation:** Converting data into suitable formats for analysis (e.g., text to numerical features).
    *   **Data Storage:** Storing processed data in a structured way (e.g., a relational database or data warehouse).
5.  **Analysis Engine:** Contains the core logic for performing analysis tasks:
    *   **Market Analysis Sub-module:** Implements algorithms for competitor analysis, trend identification, market sizing, SWOT analysis.
    *   **Lead Analysis Sub-module:** Implements logic for ICP matching, lead scoring, and qualification.
    *   **NLP Toolkit:** Utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, sentiment analysis, entity recognition (identifying companies, people, products).
    *   **Machine Learning (ML) Toolkit (Optional):** Could incorporate ML models for predictive analytics (e.g., trend forecasting) or more sophisticated lead scoring.
6.  **Lead Generation Module:** Focuses specifically on identifying and gathering information about potential leads based on the ICP and analysis results.
7.  **Reporting Module:** Generates human-readable reports, summaries, and visualizations (charts, graphs) based on the analysis results.
8.  **Knowledge Base / Memory:** Stores persistent information such as:
    *   User preferences and defined ICPs.
    *   Historical analysis results.
    *   Learned patterns and insights.
    *   Configuration data.
    *   (Potentially a vector database for semantic search over collected data).

## 4. Data Flow

1.  **Request:** User submits a request (e.g., "Analyze competitor X", "Find leads for ICP Y") via the UI Module.
2.  **Orchestration:** The Control Unit parses the request, determines the required steps and data.
3.  **Data Collection:** Control Unit tasks the Data Collection Module to gather relevant raw data from specified sources.
4.  **Data Processing:** Raw data is sent to the Data Processing Module for cleaning and structuring.
5.  **Storage (Optional):** Processed data can be stored temporarily or persistently.
6.  **Analysis:** Processed data is fed into the Analysis Engine for market analysis or lead analysis.
7.  **Lead Identification (if applicable):** Analysis results (e.g., target segments) inform the Lead Generation Module to find specific prospects and contact details.
8.  **Synthesis:** The Control Unit gathers results from various modules.
9.  **Reporting:** Results are passed to the Reporting Module to generate reports/visualizations.
10. **Response:** The final output is presented to the user via the UI Module.

## 5. Technology Stack (Potential)

*   **Programming Language:** Python (due to its extensive libraries for data science, web scraping, NLP, and AI).
*   **Core Framework:** Could leverage existing agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen) or build a custom orchestration logic.
*   **Data Collection:** Libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, specific API client libraries.
*   **Data Processing:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`.
*   **Analysis:** `NLTK`, `spaCy`, `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`/`PyTorch` (for advanced ML).
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL (for structured data), potentially a Vector Database (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone) for semantic search/memory.
*   **UI:** Streamlit / Flask / Django (for web UI), or simple CLI.
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes (for scalability).

## 6. Integration Points

*   **CRM Systems:** Design API connectors or use existing integration platforms (e.g., Zapier) to push/pull lead data from CRMs like Salesforce, HubSpot.
*   **Internal Data:** Provide mechanisms (e.g., file upload, database connection) for users to incorporate their own business data.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building the Business AI Agent. The next steps involve implementing each module, starting with the core functionalities.
