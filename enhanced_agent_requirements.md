# Market-Ready Business AI Agent: Enhanced Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the enhanced requirements for upgrading the Business AI Agent to a market-ready solution. Building upon the initial version (`agent_requirements.md`), this enhancement focuses on integrating real data sources, implementing a persistent database, adding specific industry focus (Architecture and Real Estate in India), creating proper setup instructions, and performing thorough testing.

## 2. Database Integration

*   **Requirement:** Implement a database to store and manage collected data, analysis results, user configurations (like ICPs), and potentially cached information.
*   **Database Type:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite for simplicity in deployment) is recommended for structured data like company profiles, leads, and analysis summaries. A document store or vector database could be considered for unstructured text data (news articles, web scrapes) if advanced search/retrieval is needed later.
*   **Schema Design:** Define database schemas for:
    *   Companies/Competitors (profile info, financials, news links, sentiment scores)
    *   Market Trends (trend data, sources, timestamps)
    *   Leads (prospect details, contact info, qualification status, score, ICP match)
    *   Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) (user-defined criteria)
    *   Analysis Results (SWOT, competitor reports, segment analysis)
    *   Industry-Specific Data (e.g., Real Estate projects, Architectural firms in India)
*   **Data Interaction:** Agent modules must interact with the database for:
    *   Storing newly collected data.
    *   Retrieving existing data to avoid redundant collection.
    *   Updating records (e.g., lead status, company profiles).
    *   Querying data for analysis and reporting.
*   **Data Management:** Implement basic data management capabilities (e.g., data retention policies, potential for data updates).

## 3. Real Data Integration

*   **Requirement:** Replace simulated data generation with real data collection from external sources.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Company Profiles & Financials:** Utilize APIs like Yahoo Finance (`YahooFinance/get_stock_profile`, `YahooFinance/get_stock_insights`) for publicly traded companies. For private companies, rely on web scraping (company websites, LinkedIn, directories like Crunchbase, Zauba Corp for India).
    *   **News & Trends:** Use News APIs (e.g., NewsAPI, Google News RSS) and web scraping of relevant industry publications and news sites. Google Trends can be explored for search trend data.
    *   **Social Media:** Explore APIs (if available and compliant) or scraping for sentiment analysis and trend spotting (e.g., Twitter, Reddit). *Must strictly adhere to platform ToS and privacy regulations.*
    *   **Lead Information:** Utilize web scraping of professional networks (LinkedIn - *caution: heavy scraping restrictions*), company directories, conference attendee lists (publicly available), etc. *Must strictly adhere to privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA) and data source ToS. Focus on publicly available business contact information.*
    *   **India-Specific Data (Architecture & Real Estate):**
        *   Government portals (e.g., Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, RERA websites for project registrations).
        *   Real estate listing platforms (e.g., MagicBricks, 99acres, Housing.com - *check ToS for scraping*).
        *   Industry association websites (e.g., Council of Architecture, CREDAI).
        *   Construction and infrastructure news portals specific to India.
        *   Financial reports of listed real estate/construction companies in India (using Yahoo Finance API with `region=IN`).
*   **Data Collection Module Enhancement:** Refactor the `DataCollector` class to implement actual API calls and web scraping logic, including error handling, rate limiting considerations, and respect for `robots.txt`.
*   **Data Processing Module Enhancement:** Enhance the `DataProcessor` to handle varied formats from real sources, perform robust cleaning, validation, and normalization before database insertion.

## 4. India-Specific Industry Focus (Architecture & Real Estate)

*   **Requirement:** Add specific data gathering and analysis capabilities tailored to the Architectural and Real Estate sectors in India.
*   **Data Points:**
    *   **Real Estate:** Property price trends (by city/region), new project launches (residential, commercial), RERA registration details, major developers, infrastructure developments impacting real estate, rental yields, housing loan trends.
    *   **Architecture:** Major architectural firms in India, key personnel, notable projects, design trends, government regulations related to building codes and urban planning, architectural competitions/awards.
*   **Analysis Capabilities:**
    *   Track key players and their market share/project portfolio in specific Indian cities/regions.
    *   Analyze regional real estate market health (price trends, inventory levels).
    *   Identify upcoming major construction projects for lead generation (targeting architects, developers, suppliers).
    *   Summarize relevant regulatory changes.
*   **Module Updates:** Update `DataCollector`, `DataProcessor`, and `MarketAnalyzer` to incorporate these specific data points and analysis types.

## 5. Agent Module Updates (Using Real Data & DB)

*   **Requirement:** Modify all agent modules (`MarketAnalysisAgent`, `LeadGenerationAgent`, `BusinessSupportAgent`) to utilize the database and real data pipeline.
*   **Changes:**
    *   Replace direct calls to mock data functions with calls to the enhanced `DataCollector` and database interaction methods.
    *   Adapt analysis logic (`MarketAnalyzer`, `LeadQualifier`) to work with the structure and potential inconsistencies of real data.
    *   Ensure reports (`ReportGenerator`, `LeadReportGenerator`, `AutomatedReporter`) reflect insights derived from real data.
    *   Update the UI (`BusinessAIAgentUI`) to potentially handle asynchronous data loading and display real data visualizations.

## 6. Requirements File and Setup Instructions

*   **Requirement:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary Python packages and their versions.
*   **Requirement:** Update the `README.md` file (or create a separate `SETUP.md`) with clear, step-by-step instructions for:
    *   Setting up the Python environment (e.g., using `venv`).
    *   Installing dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
    *   Setting up the database (including schema creation scripts if needed).
    *   Configuring API keys (if any are required for external services, explain how to obtain and store them securely - e.g., environment variables).
    *   Running the Streamlit application.
    *   Basic usage instructions.

## 7. Comprehensive Testing

*   **Requirement:** Perform thorough testing of all agent functionalities using the integrated real data and database.
*   **Testing Scope:**
    *   **Data Collection:** Verify data accuracy and completeness from various sources (APIs, scraping targets).
    *   **Database Operations:** Test data insertion, retrieval, updates, and querying.
    *   **Analysis Logic:** Validate the correctness of market analysis, lead scoring, and sentiment analysis results based on real data.
    *   **Industry Focus:** Test the specific features for India's Architecture and Real Estate sectors.
    *   **User Interface:** Ensure the Streamlit app correctly displays real data, handles user inputs, and presents visualizations accurately.
    *   **Error Handling:** Test robustness against API failures, scraping blocks, missing data, and database errors.
    *   **Performance:** Assess the time taken for data collection and analysis tasks.

## 8. Final Deliverable

*   A packaged zip file containing the updated codebase, `requirements.txt`, database setup scripts (if applicable), and comprehensive documentation (`README.md`, `SETUP.md`).
